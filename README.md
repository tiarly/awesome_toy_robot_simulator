This is an attempt to solve the given imaginary problem.

## Description

* The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop,
of dimensions 5 units x 5 units.
* There are no other obstructions on the table surface.
* The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table, but must be
prevented from falling to destruction. Any movement that would result in the
robot falling from the table must be prevented, however further valid movement
commands must still be allowed.

## Specifications

Create an application that can read in commands of the following form:

```
PLACE X,Y,F
MOVE
LEFT
RIGHT
REPORT
```

* `PLACE` will put the toy robot on the table in position X,Y
and facing `NORTH`, `SOUTH`, `EAST` or `WEST`.
* The origin (0,0) can be considered to be the `SOUTH WEST` most corner.
* The first valid command to the robot is a `PLACE` command,
after that, any sequence of commands may be issued, in any order,
including another `PLACE` command.
The application should discard all commands in the sequence
until a valid `PLACE `command has been executed.
* `MOVE` will move the toy robot one unit forward
in the direction it is currently facing.
* `LEFT` and `RIGHT` will rotate the robot 90 degrees
in the specified direction
without changing the position of the robot.
* `REPORT` will announce the X,Y and F of the robot.
This can be in any form, but standard output is sufficient.

* A robot that is not on the table can choose
to ignore the `MOVE`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT` and `REPORT` commands.
* Input can be from a file, or from standard input, as the developer chooses.
* Provide test data to exercise the application.
* It is not required to provide any graphical output
showing the movement of the toy robot.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'awesome_toy_robot_simulator'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install awesome_toy_robot_simulator
